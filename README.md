# NC Games Project

The deployed app can be viewed [here](https://davegreensmith.netlify.app)

## Information:

This project is an exercise in creating a front end **React** app. It makes use of the available api's from the back end project of the same name _(Back-End Northcoders Games project)_

Features used in the React app include :

- Making api requests for information (**GET**, **POST**, **PATCH** and **DELETE**)
- Having a responsive layout, depending on screen size
- Using _react states_ and _context_ (along with other react features such as _params_ and _location_)

The user is "logged in" with a default profile, and can easily navigate through the site with the use of the navigation menu
